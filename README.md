# Orbit Limit

## About the project 
Orbit Limit is a rocket project run by the Youtube Channel Orbit Limit. The project aims to create smarter model rockets that provide more easily readable data every flight and have the community's technology free for use. The project was designed to run on a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/ "Raspberry Pi Zero W") but can run on any device that can create its own wifi access point and run python programs.

## Parts of the project
The Orbit Limit Project is broken up into a few essential parts to run correctly. Breaking it up into a few parts allows us to easily update each piece and not worry about breaking everything. (More to come soon!)
